   2- Lab: Lab 7 - Interrupts 
   3- Description: In your own words, what is this code supposed to do?
   This program is a guessing game where a random number is assigned each game, and the player clicks a button
   when the number shows up on the 7 segment display to win
   4-Lab Questions:
What is the purpose of a current-limiting resistor in a seven-segment display circuit? 
  They protect the display from being damaged by overcurrent
Can you display special characters? If yes, How?
  Yes, each LED segment of the display can be lit up independently. If you only light up certain segments
  you can display special characters
What are some common applications of seven-segment displays?
  Countdown clocks, such as  NASAâ€™s countdown clock at Cape Canaveral, Florida are applications of seven-segment displays
  They are also used in appliances, such as microwaves and ovens.
